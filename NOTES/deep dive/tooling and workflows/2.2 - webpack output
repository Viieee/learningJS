webpack will take some files and bundled it into less files 
with 1 main entry file and the other as the support file if you have some dynamic importing 
in your code

you need to direct the output of this bundling with the output property (it's an object)

one of the most important property in the output object is the publicPath property,
it's used to map the path into the extra/supporting file that generated if you use dynamic importing
