every object have a prototype
prototype is an object or a fallback objects
meaning that prototype is an object that js will be look at if it searches a certain property or 
    method it can't find on the object it's currently looking at
example :

// theres an object called 'contoh' with 'property1' and 'method1' as the property and method inside it
person = {
   property1: '',
   method1: function(){

   }
}

// you try to call method that doesn't exist in the object, in this example 'method2'
person.method2();
// obviously the method we try to call doesn't exist
// this is where prototype role comes in
// it serve as a fallback object
// so js will look at the prototype for the 'method2' method
// this prototype also have a prototype
// and js will look at the prototype of the prototype
// it will keep going until it reaches the end, if it doesn't find any then undefined returned
// it also responsible to provide global default object to classes and objects (e.g toString())
