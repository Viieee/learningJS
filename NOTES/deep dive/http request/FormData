object in js that can be used to send multiple type of data and store it with ease

how to make it:
const fd = new FormData();


the cool thing about FormData and what makes it easier to work with 
is the ability to append new data into it
and the append method asks for 2 or 3 arguments
1st argument is the identifier
2nd argument is the value
3rd is the name of the file (if the 2nd argument is some type of file)

YES you can insert a file to a server with FormData

example:
fd.append('title', 'value');
