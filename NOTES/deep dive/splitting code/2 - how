we need to 'unlock' it first
how?
we need to add a special keyword that makes it clear that we want to exporting the file and makes it available 
for the other file to import

that keyword is 'export'

because when we use the traditional script importing method (in the html file)
the entire code in the file will be globally available

but if we dont do that it bassically locked from the outside and won't be globally available
